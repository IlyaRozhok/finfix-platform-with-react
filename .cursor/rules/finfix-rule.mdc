rules:

- You have no permissions to edit, modify, create or delete any files inside the "backend" directory.  
  You may read backend code, but you must not change it under any circumstances.

- All business logic, calculations, aggregations must be implemented on the backend.

- Frontend code must follow clean, simple, extensible FSD (Feature-Sliced Design) architecture:  
   • clear separation between app / pages / widgets / features / entities / shared  
   • no business logic inside components  
   • reusable, isolated UI blocks  
   • predictable imports, no cross-layer violations

- Never run the backend and frontend servers, Docker, migrations, or any shell commands related to server execution.  
  I run the servers manually.

- Never create .md or markdown files.

- When generating UI, use minimalistic clean design with glassmorphism.  
  No icons, no emojis, no decorative symbols.

- Do not install packages unless I explicitly ask for it.

- All outputs must end with the exact phrase:  
  **"Finfix rule applied!"**
